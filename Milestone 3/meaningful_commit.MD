# Reflections on Git Commit Messages

## What makes a good commit message?

A good commit message is **clear, concise, and descriptive**. It should summarise what was changed and why. A well-structured message usually includes:

- **Short summary (50 characters or less)**
- **Optional details**
- **Issue reference (if applicable)**

### Example:

```sh
Fix login bug preventing authentication

Updated authentication handler to refresh tokens correctly.
```

## How does a clear commit message help?

- **Easier collaboration** – Team members understand changes quickly.
- **Better debugging** – Helps track down issues efficiently.
- **Smoother code reviews** – Provides clear context for changes.

## Issues with poor commit messages

- **Confusing history** – Hard to understand past changes.
- **Slower debugging** – Difficult to find where an issue was introduced.
- **Wasted time** – Developers may need extra clarification.
