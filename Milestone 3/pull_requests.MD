# Reflections on Pull Requests (PRs)

## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?

Pull Requests (PRs) allow teams to review and discuss code changes before merging them. They help maintain **code quality**, prevent **bugs**, and ensure **collaboration** by allowing feedback from multiple team members. PRs also improve **version control** by keeping track of what changes were made and why.

## What makes a well-structured PR?

A good PR is **clear, focused, and well-documented**. It should:

- Have a **descriptive title** and **summary** explaining the changes.
- Be **small and focused** on a single task (instead of many unrelated changes).
- Include **context** on why the change was made.
- Be **tested** to ensure it doesn’t break existing functionality.
- Follow the **team’s coding guidelines** and be free of unnecessary changes.

## What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?

Reviewing an open-source PR taught me the importance of **clear communication** in code contributions. Well-written PR descriptions make it easier to understand changes, and structured feedback improves collaboration. It also highlighted best practices like **commit organisation, meaningful comments, and thorough testing** before submitting code.
