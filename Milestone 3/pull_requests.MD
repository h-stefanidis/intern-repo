# Reflections on Pull Requests (PRs)

## Why are PRs important in a team workflow?

Pull Requests (PRs) allow teams to review and discuss code changes before merging them. They help maintain **code quality**, prevent **bugs**, and ensure **collaboration** by allowing feedback from multiple team members. PRs also improve **version control** by keeping track of what changes were made and why.

## What makes a well-structured PR?

A good PR is **clear, focused, and well-documented**. It should:

- Have a **descriptive title** and **summary** explaining the changes.
- Be **small and focused** on a single task (instead of many unrelated changes).
- Include **context** on why the change was made.
- Be **tested** to ensure it doesn’t break existing functionality.
- Follow the **team’s coding guidelines** and be free of unnecessary changes.

## Which open-source commit did I review?

I reviewed a commit in the **[OpenTest](https://github.com/mcdcorp/opentest)** repository titled _"Add filter for test templates"_. This commit introduced a filter functionality for test templates in the OpenTest framework, enhancing the user interface by allowing more efficient navigation and selection of test templates.

**Key Changes:**

- **Objective:** Improve the user experience by adding a filtering mechanism to the test templates section.
- **Implementation:** Modified the `layout.pug` file to include the filter feature, resulting in 25 additions and 18 deletions in the codebase.
- **Outcome:** Enabled users to quickly locate specific test templates, streamlining the process of creating sessions from templates.

## What did you learn from reviewing this commit?

Reviewing this commit highlighted the importance of user interface enhancements in test automation frameworks. Even small changes, like adding a filter, can significantly improve usability. It also underscored the value of clear commit messages and concise code changes in collaborative open-source projects.
