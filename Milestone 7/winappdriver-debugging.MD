# Reflection on E2E Test Failures and Improving Test Reliability

## What are the most common reasons for E2E test failures?

- **Timing and Synchronisation Issues:**
  - Elements not loading in time or asynchronous UI updates.
  - Network latency or delays in backend responses.
- **Unstable or Dynamic Locators:**
  - Changes in the UI that cause locators to break.
  - Auto-generated IDs or elements with inconsistent properties.
- **Environmental Variability:**
  - Differences between local and CI environments.
  - Fluctuating resource availability or network issues.
- **Intermittent External Dependencies:**
  - External services, databases, or APIs failing occasionally.
- **Race Conditions:**
  - Competing operations that result in unpredictable outcomes.

## How do you determine if a test is flaky?

- **Inconsistent Results:**
  - The test passes sometimes and fails on other runs without any changes to the code.
- **Unpredictable Failures:**
  - No clear pattern to the failures; they occur randomly.
- **Re-run Analysis:**
  - Running the test multiple times (manually or via CI) reveals intermittent failures.
- **Increased Failure Rate:**
  - Monitoring test executions shows variability in success rates.

## What strategies can you use to improve test reliability?

- **Use Implicit and Explicit Waits:**
  - Implicit waits allow the driver to poll for elements globally.
  - Explicit waits target specific conditions (e.g., element visibility or clickability) for critical interactions.
- **Adopt Stable Locator Strategies:**
  - Use unique AutomationIds, stable XPath, or CSS selectors to reliably identify elements.
- **Implement Retry Logic:**
  - Reattempt actions that may fail intermittently to overcome transient issues.
- **Modular and Reusable Test Design:**
  - Use the Page Object Model (POM) and helper functions to reduce duplication and centralise UI interactions.
- **Standardize the Test Environment:**
  - Run tests on a consistent platform and configuration to minimise environmental variability.
- **Continuous Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review failing tests, adjust locators, and update wait times to keep tests robust.

## How can logging and screenshots help with debugging test failures?

- **Detailed Logging:**
  - Logs capture step-by-step execution and error messages, helping pinpoint where a test fails.
  - They provide context about timing, network requests, and interactions with the application.
- **Screenshots:**
  - Automatically capturing screenshots at the moment of failure gives a visual snapshot of the app state.
  - They help identify UI issues (e.g., misaligned elements, unexpected pop-ups) that might not be obvious from logs alone.
- **Combined Analysis:**
  - When used together, logs and screenshots offer a comprehensive view that speeds up root-cause analysis and resolution.
