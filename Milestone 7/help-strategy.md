# Reflection on Troubleshooting and Collaboration Strategies

## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?

- **Using AI:**
  - When you need a quick explanation or code example tailored to your query.
  - When you prefer a conversational, interactive approach that can clarify follow-up questions.
  - For brainstorming ideas or getting a first draft of a solution.
- **Searching Google:**
  - When you need the most up-to-date information or official documentation.
  - To access multiple perspectives, community discussions, and detailed case studies.
  - When verifying information or troubleshooting complex errors where multiple sources are beneficial.

## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?

- **Project-Specific Context:**
  - If the problem is unique to your project's environment or codebase, a colleague who is familiar with the context can provide insights that general online searches may miss.
- **Expertise and Experience:**
  - When you know a colleague has specialised knowledge about the technology or area in question.
  - If youâ€™re stuck despite using AI and Google, a quick discussion can often reveal overlooked details.
- **Time Constraints:**
  - If the issue is blocking your progress and you need immediate feedback, asking a colleague can be faster than waiting for a complete search or response from an AI.
- **Collaboration:**
  - When peer review or pair programming can help validate your approach and reduce the risk of overlooking simple mistakes.

## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?

- **Limited Perspectives:**
  - Working solo can sometimes lead to tunnel vision where you miss alternative approaches or solutions.
- **Information Overload:**
  - Sifting through conflicting advice and a large volume of search results can be overwhelming and time-consuming.
- **Isolation:**
  - Lack of immediate feedback can slow down the problem-solving process, making it harder to pinpoint issues.
- **Stress and Pressure:**
  - Troubleshooting alone under tight deadlines can increase stress, which might impair clear thinking and effective problem resolution.
- **Dependency on Self-Reliance:**
  - Relying solely on personal knowledge and available online resources might not cover all nuances, whereas collaboration can provide broader insights.
