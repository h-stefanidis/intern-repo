# Best Practices for Writing Small, Single-Purpose Functions

## Why Breaking Down Functions is Beneficial

- **Improves Readability**: Smaller functions are easier to understand.
- **Enhances Reusability**: Individual functions can be reused across the codebase.
- **Simplifies Debugging**: Issues are easier to isolate and fix when functions have clear responsibilities.
- **Encourages Maintainability**: Code is easier to update or extend when functions serve a single purpose.

## Example of a Long, Complex Function

```python
# Bad Example: A long, complex function

def process_order(order):
    total = 0
    for item in order['items']:
        total += item['price'] * item['quantity']

    if total > 100:
        discount = total * 0.1
    else:
        discount = 0

    final_total = total - discount

    print(f"Order Total: ${final_total}")

    for item in order['items']:
        print(f"Processing {item['name']}...")

    print("Order completed!")
```

### Issues:

- Does multiple things: calculates totals, applies discounts, processes items, and prints messages.
- Harder to test individual parts.

## Refactored Code with Smaller Functions

```python
# Good Example: Smaller, single-purpose functions

def calculate_total(order):
    return sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in order['items'])

def apply_discount(total):
    return total * 0.1 if total > 100 else 0

def process_items(order):
    for item in order['items']:
        print(f"Processing {item['name']}...")

def process_order(order):
    total = calculate_total(order)
    discount = apply_discount(total)
    final_total = total - discount
    print(f"Order Total: ${final_total}")
    process_items(order)
    print("Order completed!")
```

### Improvements:

- **Functions have clear, distinct responsibilities.**
- **Each function is easier to test separately.**
- **Code is more readable and maintainable.**

## How Refactoring Improved the Code Structure

Breaking down the large function into smaller, single-purpose functions improved clarity, testability, and maintainability. Each function now focuses on a specific task, making the code easier to modify and debug. This modular approach also allows for easier reuse in other parts of the project.
