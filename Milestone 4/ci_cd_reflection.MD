## CI/CD Reflection

### What is the purpose of CI/CD?

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) streamline software development by automating testing, validation, and deployment processes. CI ensures that code changes are integrated frequently and tested, catching issues early. CD automates the release process, enabling faster and more reliable deployments.

### How does automating style checks improve project quality?

Automating style checks ensures consistency, reduces human error, and enforces best practices across the codebase. It also saves developers time by catching issues early, preventing minor formatting errors from accumulating and causing larger problems down the line.

### What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?

- **False Positives:** Automated checks may sometimes flag valid code as problematic, requiring manual intervention.
- **Configuration Complexity:** Setting up and maintaining a robust CI/CD pipeline can be complex, especially for larger projects.
- **Developer Friction:** Strict enforcement can slow down the development process if not balanced properly.
- **Dependency Management:** CI/CD pipelines often rely on external services and dependencies, which need to be kept up to date.

### How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?

- **Small Projects:** Pipelines tend to be simpler, often focusing on basic linting, testing, and deployment automation. Fewer checks and faster build times make it easier to iterate quickly.
- **Large Teams:** CI/CD pipelines are more complex, incorporating multiple test environments, security scans, and performance benchmarks. They often require parallel execution, advanced rollback mechanisms, and dedicated infrastructure to handle high traffic and multiple contributors.
