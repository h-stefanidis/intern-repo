# Terminal Client & Git Learnings

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose the VSCode terminal client because it integrates seamlessly into VSCode as a centralised platform. This saves me time by eliminating the need to switch between tabs or open Command Prompt separately. I can run code and execute commands efficiently without leaving my development environment.

## What customizations (if any) did you make?

I didn’t make any customisations, as they are mostly aesthetic. I prefer keeping my VSCode layout simple and uncluttered, so I left the default settings unchanged.

## What was the most useful command you learned today?

I learned `git stash`, a handy command that temporarily saves uncommitted changes. This prevents me from losing work when switching branches and saves me the hassle of manually managing changes. It’s especially useful if I need to revert to a previous commit or recover accidentally deleted code.
