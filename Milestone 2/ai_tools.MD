# AI Tools for Development

## Which AI tools did you try?

I experimented with **GitHub Copilot** in VSCode and **ChatGPT**, and I found both to be incredibly useful!

## What worked well? What didnâ€™t?

- **GitHub Copilot**:

  - Worked well for generating boilerplate code, suggesting functions, and autocompleting complex logic.
  - Sometimes provided inaccurate or overly generic suggestions that required manual adjustments.

- **ChatGPT**:
  - Great for explaining concepts, debugging errors, and optimising code.
  - It sometimes lacked context for project-specific issues, requiring me to refine my prompts for better results.

## When do you think AI is most useful for coding?

AI is most useful when:

- Generating repetitive or boilerplate code to save time.
- Debugging issues by analysing error messages and suggesting fixes.
- Learning new programming concepts with clear, concise explanations.
- Improving code quality through suggestions for optimisation and best practices.

While AI is a powerful tool, it works best when combined with human judgment to review and refine its suggestions.
