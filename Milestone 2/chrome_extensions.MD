## VSCode Extensions & Learnings

### Which extensions did you install? Why?

As an Automation QA Engineer, I installed the following extensions to enhance my workflow:

- **React Developer Tools** – Allows inspection of React components, props, and state during UI testing, aiding in faster debugging.
- **Redux DevTools** – Helps track state changes and dispatched actions, making it easier to validate frontend behavior.
- **JSON Viewer** – Formats API responses for easier reading and debugging of structured data during test validation.
- **Lighthouse** – Performs audits on performance, accessibility, and best practices to ensure overall application quality.

These extensions improved debugging, data visibility, and overall testing efficiency.

### What was the most useful thing you learned?

I learned how the right tooling can significantly enhance QA workflows. Using extensions like Redux DevTools and JSON Viewer helped me debug more efficiently, while Lighthouse offered insights into performance issues early in development.

## Why were the React-specific Chrome extensions helpful?

- **React Developer Tools** – This extension made it much easier to debug the UI by allowing me to inspect the component tree, view props and state in real time, and monitor re-renders. It helped ensure that components were receiving the correct data and behaving as expected during automated tests.

- **Redux DevTools** – When testing Focus Bear using Redux, this tool was essential for tracking dispatched actions and changes in state. It helped me validate whether state transitions were working correctly after user interactions or API calls, which is crucial for writing reliable automated tests.

These extensions gave me clear visibility into the frontend logic, which made writing, debugging, and verifying automated tests much faster and more effective.

## Suggested Chrome Extensions for QA Work

- **Selenium IDE** – Record and playback UI tests quickly.
- **SelectorsHub** – Generate accurate XPath/CSS selectors for automation scripts.
- **Postman Interceptor** – Capture browser API calls directly into Postman.
- **Bug Magnet** – Quickly test edge cases and input validation.
- **ModHeader** – Modify headers/cookies to simulate different user scenarios.
