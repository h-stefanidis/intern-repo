# VSCode Extensions & Learnings

## Which extensions did you install? Why?

As an Automation QA Engineer, I installed the following extensions to enhance my workflow:

- **React Developer Tools** – Allows me to inspect React components and understand their state and props during testing.
- **Redux DevTools** – Helps debug Redux state, ensuring correct state management in applications.
- **JSON Viewer** – Formats and pretty-prints API responses, making it easier to analyse structured data.
- **Lighthouse** – Performs performance audits on web applications to identify potential optimisations.

These extensions streamline debugging, improve efficiency, and help ensure high-quality applications.

## What was the most useful thing you learned?

I learned how essential it is to have the right tools integrated into my development and testing environment. Using extensions like Redux DevTools and JSON Viewer significantly improves debugging efficiency, while Lighthouse helps optimise application performance. Proper tooling enhances both automation testing and overall workflow, making issue detection and resolution much faster.
