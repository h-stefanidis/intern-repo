# Git Experience & Learnings

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I have used Git before. I started using it at the beginning of my Master's degree. In Semester 1, I worked on a group project where an experienced frontend engineer helped me get set up with Git and GitHub. They guided me through the process of pulling from the main codebase, making commits, and pushing changes.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I chose to use the Windows Git client through VSCode because it allows me to write code and execute Git commands within the same software. Managing multiple applications separately can be stressful and inconvenient, so having everything centralised in VSCode makes my workflow smoother.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

I realised that I had been making merge conflict resolution harder for myself than necessary. By following proper practices—such as regularly pulling from the main codebase—I could have reduced or even avoided conflicts entirely. Keeping my code up to date and using better Git workflows makes development much easier.
