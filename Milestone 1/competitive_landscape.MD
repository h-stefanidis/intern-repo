# Competitive Landscape: Focus Bear vs. Other Productivity Apps

## What Makes Focus Bear Different?

Focus Bear stands out by focusing on **habit-building**, specifically catering to **neurodiverse individuals**. While **Freedom** and **Cold Turkey** primarily function as website and app blockers, Focus Bear goes further by integrating **reminders, routines, and guided focus sessions** to help users stay on track. This **holistic approach** not only blocks distractions but also **fosters long-term productivity habits**.

## Why Choose Focus Bear Over Competitors?

As a user, I would choose Focus Bear due to its **all-in-one approach**—it doesn’t just block distractions but actively **supports habit formation**. Other apps may effectively remove distractions, but they lack the **structured habit support and accessibility features** that make Focus Bear a better fit for individuals who struggle with traditional productivity tools.

## One Feature Other Apps Have That Focus Bear Doesn’t

A standout feature from **Tiimo** is its **visual scheduling and time-blocking system**, which is particularly beneficial for **neurodivergent users**. While Focus Bear already structures routines, implementing a **clear visual planner** could enhance **usability and engagement**, making it easier for users to track their schedules at a glance.

## One Improvement Focus Bear Could Make

To further enhance its usability, Focus Bear could introduce a **more flexible and customisable scheduling system**, similar to **Tiimo or Routinery**. While the current habit system is effective, adding **adjustable time slots and better calendar integration** would give users greater control over their scheduling and **improve time management capabilities**.
