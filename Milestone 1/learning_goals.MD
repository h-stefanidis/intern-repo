# Internship Reflection

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to improve my coding skills, specifically in **Python** to test applications, and eventually become confident enough to work independently without relying on others. I also want to gain experience working with a team in a professional environment and take my first step into the **Data Science industry**.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?

Although I already have **communication and leadership skills**, I'm excited to further develop them in a **workplace setting**. The transition from university to a professional environment presents new challenges, and I aim to grow both technically and professionally. As a **QA Engineer**, I want to contribute meaningfully to the team and establish myself as a valuable coworker at **Focus Bear**.

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I bring **strong interpersonal, communication, and leadership skills**. I am highly sociable and can build positive relationships with **stakeholders and coworkers**, making me well-suited for conflict resolution and team collaboration. Additionally, I have confidence in my **programming abilities**, and I hope to refine my skills further to **enhance the quality** of Focus Bear’s application.

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?

I would like to improve my **technical expertise**, particularly in coding. While I am confident in **Python and SQL** (data science languages), I am less experienced in **frontend development**, which limits my versatility as a full-stack developer. Additionally, I sometimes rely on **AI assistance** when facing challenges, and I hope to develop the **self-sufficiency** needed to confidently teach others my coding processes.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success means seeing **tangible improvements** in the **Focus Bear application**. I want to contribute to making meaningful changes that improve **user satisfaction** and **app performance**. Achieving set goals—whether from myself, my supervisor, or **Jeremy**—will be a key indicator of success. Ultimately, I want to see the impact of my work through **bug fixes, improved features, and positive user feedback**.
