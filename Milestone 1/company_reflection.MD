**Why Was Focus Bear Created?**
Focus Bear was created to improve productivity of neurodiverse individuals. This applies moreso to those with ADHD and ASD, but can be applied to the wider population. The aim of Focus Bear is ultimately to reduce distractions and burnout of individuals when they are looking to complete work, whether education related or something else.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**
Focus Bear is catering to people who are neurodiverse, typically involving autism, ADHD, ADD, ASD, and multiple other types of diagnoses similar to the previously mentioned. This application prioritises productivity and ensures that individuals with such neurodiversity can lead more productive lives by completing work that they should be doing instead of being distracted by external factors like social media.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**
This mission is important as people with neurodiverse conditions are limited to completing their allocated tasks, whether due to distractions, or other factors. If harnessed correctly, those with ADHD (an example) can have their productivity skyrocket, and thus make themselves feel significantly more valued as an individual after completing a series of tasks to a high degree of quality and at a fast pace.

**How does Focus Bearâ€™s work align with your personal values or interests?**
Focus Bear aligns with my personal values like productivity in general. On my own, I can be very productive but I tend to get distracted by my phone and social media, limiting my ability to complete tasks within a certain timeframe. Having an application like Focus Bear to keep me on track, or others for that matter, is an amazing tool which should be utilised in more industries. I want to be able to help others with autism and ADHD become more efficient workers, and this is an excellent way to begin my approach in such a matter.

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**
Yes. When I get in the zone, I tend to be super productive and work for hours on end without needing to drink or eat. This is good, but also negative as when I'm not concentrated, I tend to become distracted quite easily and struggle to complete work on time. This doesn't occur often, but having a personal application to assist me and push me into completing my goals is something I can relate to heavily.
