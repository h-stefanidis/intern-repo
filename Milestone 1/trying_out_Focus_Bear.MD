# Trying Out Focus Bear – User Experience Reflection

## First Impression

My initial impression of Focus Bear was that it felt **somewhat overwhelming** at first. The interface wasn’t very clean, making it **hard to navigate** both at the start and even after continued use. While the **guided onboarding** and **habit tracking** were nice additions, they could be **significantly refined** to make the experience more intuitive—especially for users who are not as technologically savvy.

## Difficulties & Confusing Aspects

One major difficulty was the **onboarding process**, particularly when selecting preset options to organize my **routine and schedule**. The **overall layout and UI** made it difficult to focus on different aspects of the setup, which felt overwhelming. As a result, I had to take extra time to **figure out what I was supposed to do**, rather than having a clear, structured flow guiding me through the process.
